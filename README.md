I have made some clothing for White Widow' job, both male and female versions, for fivem [ADD-ON] 

I have made some clothing for White Widow' job, both male and female versions, and they are free. I am still learning, so if you find any issues, please let me know and I will do my best to fix them. I will be making all job outfits free. I would like to thank TayMcKenzieNZ for allowing me to use their models and for their advice. You can also check out their free job outfits and other stuff in the link.
