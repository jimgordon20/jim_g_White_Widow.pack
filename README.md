I have made some clothing for White Widow' job, both male and female versions, for fivem [ADD-ON] 

I have made some clothing for White Widow' job, both male and female versions, and they are free. I am still learning, so if you find any issues, please let me know and I will do my best to fix them. I will be making all job outfits free. I would like to thank TayMcKenzieNZ for allowing me to use their models and for their advice. You can also check out their free job outfits and other stuff in the link.

info.
This clothing pack was tested on gamebuild mpchristmas3 aka 2802 with the understanding that there are about 14 additional free .ymt slots to be used

If for whatever reason you crash using this pack, please read here and perhaps consider downgrading your gamebuild until Rockstar Games increases the YMT limits 3 on/for future DLCs.
